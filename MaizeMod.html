<p style="font-weight: bold">Y-field inputs for Cox's corn data</p>

<p>The general purpose version of the Y-field software was written as a testing facility during the development of the theory itself and was not intended to cater for the special requirements of arbitrary field trials.  Cox's corn plant spacing arrangements (with their fixed row width of 0.75 m.) therefore necessitated two work-arounds, namely:  (a) to convert plant population density to the I-plane dimensions of the software and (b) to convert row width-density combinations to the aspect ratio inputs of the software.   The results of these conversions are listed below.</p>

<p>For example, to enter treatment 4 (density = 5.19 p/sq.m.) into the software, first select I-plane dimensions of 8.78 x 8.78.   Then select a number of plants = 11 x 11 array, click Confirm, select an Aspect ratio of 2.92 and start the simulation. Any other combination of I-plane dimension and aspect ratio for treatment 4 will produce a result but will not correctly represent Cox's original treatment.</p>
